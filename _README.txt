A fast, responsive and minimal theme based on the zh2 theme, inspired by our website's layout simplicity.

We made it more readable and faster through the use of system fonts rendered in bigger size.
It is only 138 Kb, and it has an archives page, a title with the tagline and includes full control of your content for easier, more straighforward blogging.

This theme is uncopyrighted -- use as you like, spread it, sell it, do whatever you want. Thanks and enjoy.


Basic Setup
---------------------------------
You'll need to edit several pages in the Wordpress theme editor - go to Wordpress admin, then Appearance, then editor (after you've activated this theme).

Then go to this page for instructions: https://github.com/danilosierrac/mimosaminimal/blob/master/README.md

This theme is designed to be as minimalist as possible, so I've stripped out a lot of functions that other themes have. That's the choice I've made and I like it that way.

This theme is "as is" - any bugs, you need to fix it. Any changes you want, you'll need to make them.
